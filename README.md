# [Showray](https://showray.sipped.org/)
Showray is a website which lets you create and design **music release pages** to share with your listeners. The catch is - it's completely free, you don't need to give us any attribution or credits, you host the page yourself, and you can change anything!

[<kbd> <br> showray.sipped.org <br> </kbd>](https://showray.sipped.org)

## Is it really free?
**Yes!** Creating and designing a music release page on Showray is completely free with no catches. The code is open-source too. However if you want custom features, changes or something else, you can always [contact us](#Contact) to request anything else! - Alternatively, use [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/sipped) to tip or become a member - and then - request any feature.

## But why not use alternatives? Like Linkfire?
Sure, but you're missing one thing. **Showray is free**, open-source, you don't have to credit us, there are no hidden watermarks, there are no hidden mentions of Showray, and also our release page design and functionality is arguably better. Just look at it!!

![Why choose Showray over alternatives](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sippedaway/Showray/refs/heads/main/github/whyshowray.png)

## Features
- Add any custom streaming service or website
- Customizable button icons via [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
- A **second Spotify button** for opening your music in the Spotify app
- A **Share** button to easily share your music with others
- An arguably better-than-others design
- Frequent updates and user feedback + requests
- A page design that resizes for all screen sizes

and that's not it... **We're working on more!** Think: Spotify embedding, playlists, universal sharing, custom domains, music videos, media players... anddd more.
